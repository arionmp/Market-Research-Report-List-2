<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pipeline Demagnetizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent-magnet Demagnetizer</li><li>Stored-energy Demagnetizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Permanent-magnet demagnetizers are designed to continuously demagnetize permanent magnets without the need for an external power source, making them efficient and cost-effective. On the other hand, stored-energy demagnetizers store energy in a magnetic field and then quickly release it to demagnetize materials. This type of demagnetizer is particularly useful for large-scale industrial applications that require rapid demagnetization of ferrous materials. Both types of demagnetizers play a crucial role in industries such as manufacturing, electronics, and automotive.</p></p>
