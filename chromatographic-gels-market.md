<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chromatographic Gels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Irregular Shape</li><li>Spherical Shape</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chromatographic gels are commonly classified into two main types based on their shape: irregular shape and spherical shape. Irregular shape chromatographic gels have a less uniform structure, resulting in a higher surface area and better resolution for separating complex mixtures. On the other hand, spherical shape chromatographic gels have a more uniform structure, allowing for faster separation and higher flow rates. Both types of chromatographic gels have their own advantages and are used in various applications based on the specific requirements of the separation process.</p></p>
