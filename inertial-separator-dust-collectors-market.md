<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inertial Separator Dust Collectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Colliding Type</li><li>Rotary Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inertial separator dust collectors are commonly available in two main types: colliding type and rotary type. Colliding type inertial separators use a sudden change in direction to separate dust particles from the air stream through collision. On the other hand, rotary type separators use a rotating drum or cylinder to create centrifugal force, which forces dust particles to separate from the air stream. Both types are efficient in capturing solid particles from air and are commonly used in industrial applications for air pollution control.</p></p>
