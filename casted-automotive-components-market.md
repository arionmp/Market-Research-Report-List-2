<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Casted Automotive Components Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Squeeze Casting</li><li>Investment Casting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Casted automotive components are manufactured using various methods, with two common types being squeeze casting and investment casting. Squeeze casting involves applying pressure to molten metal to fill the mold quickly and accurately, resulting in high precision parts with minimal defects. On the other hand, investment casting uses a wax pattern that is coated in ceramic, then melted out to create a hollow mold for pouring molten metal. Both methods are popular in the automotive industry for producing complex and high-quality components.</p></p>
