<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Expansion Thermometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Expansion Thermometer</li><li>Gas Expansion Thermometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Expansion thermometers are used to measure temperature changes by utilizing the expansion or contraction of a liquid or gas. In the liquid expansion thermometer market, a temperature change causes the liquid to expand or contract, moving an index on a scale to indicate the temperature. Gas expansion thermometers work similarly, but with a gas-filled bulb instead of a liquid. Both types of expansion thermometers are commonly used in industrial settings for their accuracy and reliability in measuring temperature changes.</p></p>
