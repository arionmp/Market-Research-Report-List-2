<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Surface Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Road surface sensors come in two types: active and passive. Active sensors actively emit signals, usually electromagnetic waves, and measure how they interact with the road surface to gather information such as texture, roughness, or moisture. Passive sensors, on the other hand, do not emit signals but rely on natural energy sources, such as sunlight or thermal radiation, to gather data from the road surface. Both types of sensors play a crucial role in monitoring road conditions and ensuring safe driving environments.</p></p>
