<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Crystal Polymers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lyotropic Liquid-Crystal</li><li>Thermotropic Liquid-Crystal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid Crystal Polymers are classified into two main types - Lyotropic Liquid-Crystal and Thermotropic Liquid-Crystal. Lyotropic Liquid-Crystals are formed when the polymer chains are dissolved in a solvent and then aligned into a liquid-crystalline structure. These polymers have properties that vary with the concentration of the solvent. Thermotropic Liquid-Crystals exhibit liquid-crystalline behavior when subjected to changes in temperature. These polymers have ordered molecular arrangements that change with temperature, leading to unique physical properties such as increased stiffness and strength.</p></p>
