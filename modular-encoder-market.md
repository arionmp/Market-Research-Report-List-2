<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modular Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental Encoders</li><li>Absolute Encoders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Modular encoders are classified into two main types: incremental encoders and absolute encoders. Incremental encoders generate a series of pulses to indicate changes in position, making them suitable for applications where relative position is important. Absolute encoders, on the other hand, provide a unique digital code for each position, allowing them to track the exact position without needing a reference point. Both types offer different advantages depending on the specific application requirements, leading to a diverse market for modular encoders.</p></p>
