<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Caprolactum Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>From Phenol</li><li>From Cyclohexane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Caprolactam market types refer to the two main production methods for caprolactam: from phenol and from cyclohexane. Caprolactam produced from phenol involves the oxidation of cyclohexanone to form caprolactam, while caprolactam produced from cyclohexane requires the hydrolysis of cyclohexanone to produce adipic acid, which is then converted to caprolactam. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, efficiency, and environmental impact, leading to different market dynamics for each type.</p></p>
