<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CCD Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Area Scan Camera</li><li>Line Scan Camera</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CCD cameras come in two main types: area scan cameras and line scan cameras. Area scan cameras capture a complete image at once, making them ideal for still or slow-moving subjects. They are commonly used in applications such as surveillance, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. Line scan cameras, on the other hand, capture a continuous image by scanning a single line at a time. This type of camera is often used in applications where high-speed, high-resolution imaging is required, such as in production line monitoring and postal sorting.</p></p>
