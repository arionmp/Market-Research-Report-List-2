<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biliary Lithotripter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Lithotripter</li><li>Ultrasonic Lithotripter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biliary lithotripters are devices used to break up bile duct stones. There are two main types of biliary lithotripters: mechanical lithotripters, which use a mechanical mechanism to break up stones, and ultrasonic lithotripters, which use ultrasonic waves to break up stones. Mechanical lithotripters typically use a basket or balloon to capture and crush the stones, while ultrasonic lithotripters use high-frequency sound waves to break up the stones without the need for physical contact. Both types of lithotripters are effective in treating bile duct stones.</p></p>
