<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Steel Rebars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deformed Steel</li><li>Mild Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon steel rebars are used in construction for reinforcement purposes. There are two main types in the market - deformed steel rebars and mild steel rebars. Deformed steel rebars have ribs on the surface to improve concrete adhesion, while mild steel rebars have a smooth surface. Deformed steel rebars are generally preferred for their higher tensile strength and better bonding with concrete, making them suitable for high-stress construction projects. Mild steel rebars are commonly used in low-stress applications where cost is a major factor.</p></p>
