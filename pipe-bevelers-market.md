<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pipe Bevelers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inside Diameter (ID) Mount</li><li>Outside Diameter (OD) Mount</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pipe bevelers are tools used to create bevels or angled edges on pipes for welding purposes. There are two main types of pipe bevelers based on how they are mounted: Inside Diameter (ID) Mount and Outside Diameter (OD) Mount. ID mount bevelers are attached to the inside of the pipe and are used for beveling the inside edge. On the other hand, OD mount bevelers are attached to the outer surface of the pipe for beveling the outside edge. Both types cater to different requirements in the piping industry.</p></p>
